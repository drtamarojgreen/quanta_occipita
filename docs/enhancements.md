# ðŸŒ± Module Enhancement Opportunities

## UX or CLI Improvements
- [ ] Streamline feedback or log formats
- [ ] Add verbosity toggles or progress display
- [X] Add command-line flags to selectively enable or disable features (e.g., `--no-tests`).
- [X] Implement a `--dry-run` mode to show which files and directories would be created without writing them.
- [X] Add an interactive mode that prompts the user for the module name and other configuration options.

## Learning & Adaptation
- [ ] Integrate new pattern recognition or behavior shaping logic
- [ ] Enable module to update itself from verified QuantaGlia knowledge

## Resilience Features
- [ ] Better handling of low-resource environments
- [ ] Soft fallback routines when encountering unknown inputs
- [X] Add robust checks to prevent overwriting existing user files unless explicitly forced with a `--force` flag.
- [X] Before execution, verify that all necessary dependencies (like Git) are installed and available in the user's PATH.

## Interoperability
- [ ] Enable tighter scheduling control via QuantaParent
- [ ] Improve YAML or JSON config readability

## Future Roadmap
- [ ] Federated integration across machines?
- [ ] Test in embedded or containerized environments
- [ ] Allow users to provide their own custom templates for generating code, docs, and tests.
- [ ] Add support for more programming languages beyond C++, such as Python, Rust, or Go.
