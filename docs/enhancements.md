# ðŸŒ± Module Enhancement Opportunities

## UX or CLI Improvements
- [ ] Streamline feedback or log formats
- [ ] Add verbosity toggles or progress display
- [X] Add command-line flags to selectively enable or disable features (e.g., `--no-tests`).
- [X] Implement a `--dry-run` mode to show which files and directories would be created without writing them.
- [X] Add an interactive mode that prompts the user for the module name and other configuration options.

## Learning & Adaptation
- [ ] Integrate new pattern recognition or behavior shaping logic
- [ ] Enable module to update itself from verified QuantaGlia knowledge

## Resilience Features
- [ ] Better handling of low-resource environments
- [ ] Soft fallback routines when encountering unknown inputs
- [X] Add robust checks to prevent overwriting existing user files unless explicitly forced with a `--force` flag.
- [X] Before execution, verify that all necessary dependencies (like Git) are installed and available in the user's PATH.

## Interoperability
- [ ] Enable tighter scheduling control via QuantaParent
- [ ] Improve YAML or JSON config readability

## Future Roadmap
- [ ] Federated integration across machines?
- [ ] Test in embedded or containerized environments
- [ ] Allow users to provide their own custom templates for generating code, docs, and tests.
- [ ] Add support for more programming languages beyond C++, such as Python, Rust, or Go.

## Community-Suggested Enhancements (Batch 1)

### CLI & User Experience (UX)
1.  [ ] Add a `--version` flag to display the current version of the script.
2.  [ ] Implement a `--help` command that provides more detailed usage information than the README.
3.  [ ] Add a `--quiet` or `--silent` mode to suppress all non-essential output.
4.  [ ] Implement color-coded output for warnings, errors, and success messages (using PowerShell's native capabilities).
5.  [ ] Add a confirmation prompt before generating files in a non-empty directory.
6.  [ ] Display a summary of the selected options and module name before proceeding with generation.
7.  [ ] Add a `--list-templates` flag to show available module templates.
8.  [ ] Implement a `--skip-git` flag to prevent all git-related actions.
9.  [ ] Add a `--no-banner` flag to hide the ASCII art/welcome message for faster execution.
10. [ ] Remember the last-used settings (e.g., author name) in a local config file (`.quanta_config`) and reuse them.
11. [ ] Add a `--report` flag to generate a summary file of all actions taken.
12. [ ] Improve progress indicators during file generation (e.g., "Creating file X... done.").
13. [ ] Add a command to `update` an existing module with new boilerplate features.
14. [ ] Implement an `eject` command to remove all QuantaOccipita-specific files from a project.
15. [ ] Add a `--timestamp` flag to append a timestamp to the generated module directory.

### Code Generation (C++ & Boilerplate)
16. [ ] Add an option to generate a C-style header guard (`#ifndef...#define...#endif`) instead of `#pragma once`.
17. [ ] Allow specifying the C++ standard version (e.g., 11, 14, 17, 20) to be included in comments or build scripts.
18. [ ] Generate a basic `Doxyfile` for Doxygen documentation.
19. [ ] Include a sample `.clang-format` file with default styling rules.
20. [ ] Add an option to generate a singleton class pattern.

32. [ ] Add an option to generate a simple Observer pattern skeleton.
33. [ ] Generate a class with virtual destructors by default.
34. [ ] Add an option to generate a static library vs. a shared library skeleton in the `CMakeLists.txt`.
35. [ ] Include a comment block for copyright and license information at the top of each source file.

### Configuration (YAML)
36. [ ] Add a `--no-config` flag to skip the generation of the `config.yaml` file.
37. [ ] Validate the module name provided by the user to ensure it's a valid filename.
38. [ ] Allow users to specify a custom path for the output directory.
39. [ ] Add an option to generate the config file in JSON format instead of YAML.
40. [ ] Include more diverse examples in the default `config.yaml` (e.g., lists, nested objects).
41. [ ] Add comments to the `config.yaml` explaining each default setting.
42. [ ] Generate a corresponding C++ struct/class to parse the `config.yaml` file (requires a parsing library, so maybe just the skeleton).
43. [ ] Add a section in `config.yaml` for metadata like version, author, and email.
44. [ ] Allow specifying default config values via command-line arguments.
45. [ ] Ensure the generated YAML is compliant with a specific version of the YAML standard.

49. [ ] Add an option to automatically push the initial commit to a remote named `origin`.
50. [ ] Prompt the user for a remote URL if they choose to push.
51. [ ] Check if the directory is already a git repository before offering to initialize a new one.
52. [ ] If it is a git repo, offer to create a new commit on the current branch instead.
53. [ ] Add an option to automatically tag the initial commit with a version number (e.g., `v0.1.0`).
54. [ ] Generate a `CHANGELOG.md` file with an initial "v0.1.0" entry.
55. [ ] Allow user to specify a git remote name other than `origin`.

### Documentation Generation

62. [ ] Add a section to the generated `README.md` on how to build and run the code.
63. [ ] Add a section on how to run the tests.
64. [ ] Generate a placeholder `docs` directory within the module directory for more detailed documentation.
65. [ ] Add a `--no-docs` flag to skip creating documentation.

### Script Resilience & Error Handling
66. [ ] Check for write permissions in the target directory before starting generation.

68. [ ] Implement a cleanup routine to remove partially generated files if the script fails midway.
69. [ ] Add a check to ensure the module name doesn't contain invalid characters.
70. [ ] Warn the user if they are running the script with elevated (Administrator) privileges.
71. [ ] Check for minimum required PowerShell version before executing.
72. [ ] Add a `--force` flag to bypass safety checks like overwriting directories.
73. [ ] Create a log file of all actions performed during generation.
74. [ ] Handle `Ctrl+C` interruption gracefully, cleaning up any created files.
75. [ ] Validate user input for prompts to prevent errors.

### Testing (Catch2 Skeletons)
76. [ ] Add an option to skip generating the `test/` directory.
77. [ ] Generate a test case that includes the module's main header file to ensure it's includable.
78. [ ] Add a sample test case using `REQUIRE` that fails by default, encouraging TDD.
79. [ ] Generate a separate test file for each class generated.
80. [ ] Add comments to the test file explaining how to add new test cases.
81. [ ] Generate a `CMakeLists.txt` in the `test/` directory to build the tests.
82. [ ] Add an option to generate a test skeleton for other frameworks like Google Test. (This might border on new libs, but generating the skeleton is okay).
83. [ ] Name the test file after the module (e.g., `MyModule.test.cpp`).
84. [ ] Add a simple script (`run_tests.sh` or `.ps1`) to compile and run the tests.
85. [ ] The generated test `main.cpp` should be pre-filled with the Catch2 main macro.

### Extensibility & Customization
86. [ ] Allow users to define their own code snippets/templates in a local directory that the script can use.

88. [ ] Allow specifying the author's name and email via environment variables.
89. [ ] Create a configuration file for QuantaOccipita itself, so users can set their own defaults.
