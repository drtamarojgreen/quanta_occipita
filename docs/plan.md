# ðŸ“˜ Module Planning Document

## Module Name
- QuantaOccipita

## Purpose
- To bootstrap and accelerate the development of new QuantaSoft modules by generating standardized boilerplate code, configuration files, and documentation.
- It serves as a foundational developer tool to ensure consistency and adherence to project standards.

## Goals
- [X] **Boilerplate Code Generation**: Generate starter source files (.cpp, .h) with module skeletons based on the QuantaSynapse template style.
- [X] **Configuration File Initialization**: Create a default YAML config file (config.yaml) with safe example values and explanatory comments.
- [X] **Git Commit & Push Prompt**: After creating files, prompt the user to optionally initialize a git repository, commit the files with a standard message, and push to a specified remote branch.
- [X] **Issue Templates**: Generate `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory with markdown templates for bug reports, feature requests, and ethical concerns.
- [X] **Unit Test Skeletons**: Create a `test/` directory with minimal test files using a chosen framework (e.g., Catch2 for C++) to verify basic module behaviors.
- [X] **Documentation Indexing**: Append or create a central `README.md` index in the repo root, adding entries that link to the new module's `plan.md`, `enhancements.md`, and code docs.

## Integration Plan
- As a developer tool, QuantaOccipita runs in the local development environment and does not directly integrate with the runtime components of the QuantaSoft agent ecosystem (QuantaSensa, QuantaEthos, etc.). Its primary interaction is with the file system and the user's Git client.

## Notes
- **Anticipated constraints**: The tool currently relies on a specific template style (QuantaSynapse) and a single testing framework (Catch2). It is designed for C++ projects.
- **Potential edge cases**: The tool might encounter issues if run in a directory that is not a valid Git repository or if the user lacks the necessary permissions to write files. It also assumes a Unix-like environment for file paths and commands.
